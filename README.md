# Laravel Addressable

I would appreciate you taking the time to look at my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/faustbrian) and considering to support me if I'm saving you some time with my work.

## Installation

Require this package, with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), in the root directory of your project.

``` bash
$ composer require faustbrian/laravel-addressable
```

Now add the service provider within `app/config/app.php`.

``` php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    BrianFaust\Addressable\AddressableServiceProvider::class
];
```

You can publish the migration with:

```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BrianFaust\Addressable\AddressableServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

After the migration has been published you can create the role- and permission-tables by running the migrations:

```bash
$ php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BrianFaust\Addressable\AddressableServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

## Usage

### Setup a Model
``` php
<?php

namespace App;

use BrianFaust\Addressable\HasAddresses;
use BrianFaust\Addressable\Interfaces\HasAddress;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Order extends Model implements HasAddress
{
    use HasAddresses;
}
```

### Get an address by role
``` php
$user->address('billing');
```

### Set the role of an address
``` php
$user->address('billing', Address::find(1));
```

### Create a new address (with a role)

    'country_id' => 26,
    'name_prefix' => 'Mrs',
    'first_name' => 'John',
    'last_name' => 'Doe',
