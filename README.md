# Laravel Addressable

## Installation

Require this package, with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), in the root directory of your project.

``` bash
$ composer require faustbrian/laravel-addressable
```

And then include the service provider within `app/config/app.php`.

``` php
BrianFaust\Addressable\AddressableServiceProvider::class
```

To get started, you'll need to publish the vendor assets and migrate the countries table:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BrianFaust\Addressable\AddressableServiceProvider" && php artisan migrate
```

Now you can seed the countries into the database like this.

```bash
php artisan countries:seed
```
